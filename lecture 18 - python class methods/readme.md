Main lessons learned:

* dunder allows cleaner, elegant code
* classes will change type, different from int, str, float, bool, yet the same idea
* oop is for code readability by me or anyone
* class is a blueprint of how a code will function
	* and inside class are methods which allow class objects to perform different things
